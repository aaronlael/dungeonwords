Dungeon Exploration/Navigation Word Game

## Synopsis

Dungeon words is a game similar to a crossword puzzle, there are voids/walls and open tiles to place words from a provided wordbank.  Words placed that intersect and touch must form valid words at all points with adjacent words.  That is the end of the similarities, though.

The object of the game is to create a word chain that takes you from the dungeon room entrance to the exit.  The game is scored based on how many words are in your path through the dungeon.

* placing extra words jutting out that don't actually go anywhere do not count toward your path, but can allow you to interact with the room in unique ways.
